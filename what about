what about
a real time game

run one process, does game mechanics,
run other process just to access game

i.e. virtual villagers lol


ideas:
- have each entity be some sort of process
    >>> this is kinda unnecessary, isn't it?
    >>> besides using the 'kill' function why else would we use it
    >>> you can get info on how old each person is and how much memory they have used with top
    >>> thus, it would be more of a low-level game rather than a high-level game?
    >>> both interfaces exist
    >>> cool.

- just run the other process on a server, lol. This makes it a MULTIPLAYER real time game. swage.

- what would be the theme? virtual villagers? some kind of 'ant farm'? plants? fish? 
    >>> animals are a good idea. They're a lot simpler to implement than humans, and more advanced than plants.
    >>> In addition, we can implement a sort of evolution mechanic, which allows for dynamicness.
i.e. ||| evo game |||


- we can have the program write to a txt file instead of storing all its variables inside the program. Although this makes it slower, it eliminates the need to save, and also gives a sense a finality and realisticity into the game (no reload and start over, heheh. At least not without copying files and stuff)
