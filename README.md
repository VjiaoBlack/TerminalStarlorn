It seems like aliens are once again trying to invade Earth in their fancy spaceships!
Oh no! Who will save us from the evil about to take over?

You (the green spaceship on the bottom) will be attempting to fend off the alien 
spaceships (those on the top) for as long as possible. Press spacebar to shoot, 
and the wasd keys to use your engines!

Remember, due to being in space, you must toggle an engine to start moving, and
toggle the reverse one to stop!

Unfortunately, your spaceship isn't the best one the US Military has (better ones
are currently on a mission to repopulate Mars) so whenever you toggle any engine, 
your shooting mechanism locks shut, and must be re-initiated (press and hold the
spacebar again) to be resumed.

Good luck!





FAQ: 
Q: How do I change the screen size? Can I change the screen size?
A: Sure you can! On the main menu, go down to Settings and press enter. Then, 
highlight (using the WS or up/down arrow keys) the parameter you want to change,
press enter, type in the parameter size (maximum 3 digits!) and press enter again.
To go back to the main menu, highlight Back, and press enter. Your settings are 
saved automatically in preferences.txt, so there's no need to constantly resize
the screen to your favorite size!

Q: How do I exit the game?
A: :( . You can either highlight 'Exit' on the main menu and press enter, or keep
pressing 'q'. That will eventually get you to the main menu. You can then press 
'q' to exit, or use the first method.
