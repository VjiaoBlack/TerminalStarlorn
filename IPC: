IPC:
pipe, fifo, signal, semaphore, message queue, shared memory, sockets.

signals are usually interruptions, and thus are usually fatal errors. i.e. ctrl+c during a program's runtime.
You can do four things with this signal:
1) it kills u cuz u didnt expect it :P the process closes instantly without cleaning up (files will be closed, and yeah).
2) ctrlz is also a signal
3) signals are asynchronous

4) yolo..oOOo..oOOo..oOOo..oOOo..oOOo..oOO
   ****00*''*OO*''*OO*''*OO*''*OO*''*OO*


sockets: intermachine networking. Communicate between machines and between processes on different machines.
